# Snow Globe with a Twist

The centerpiece of our winter wonderland is a large, transparent snow globe. But, what is usually inside the globe is on the outside and vice versa. Outside the globe, there is snow falling on penguins and a reindeer with a sleigh that would typically be festive decorations within a snow globe. There are also presents scattered everywhere creating a maze for the reindeer with the sleigh who can be taken through the maze using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Inside the globe, there are hills and trees, but there is also a human that has been trapped! Usually, a human would be the one looking inside the globe to see the snow falling and festive animals, but now the penguins and reindeer are looking at the human in the globe. This inversion creates a unique world where the boundaries between the small, controlled environment of the snow globe and the real world are gone. Our goal was to use our creativity to step outside the box and create an interactive and unexpected winter wonderland world that users are able to interact with.
